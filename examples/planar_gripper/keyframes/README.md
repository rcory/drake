## Keyframe Text Files

There are currently three keyframe text files in this repository. These
keyframes were generated by solving a contact-explicit trajectory optimization
problem. The files are:

planar_brick_multi_mode.txt: Joint keyframes for a multi-contact-mode planar
brick rotation.

pinned_brick_multi_mode.txt: Joint keyframes for a multi-contact-mode pinned
brick rotation.

pinned_brick_single_mode.txt: Joint keyframes for a single-contact-mode pinned
brick rotation. Note: the contact modes are ignore in this file.

For an explanation of the formatting of these files, see the method
`ParseKeyframesAndModes` in `planar_gripper_common.h`.
